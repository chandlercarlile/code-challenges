# GridCollection

Now that we have a game that we can move around in, let's add something to it!

Your player should be able to walk around and collect coins!

Each time you collect a coin, it should add to a running total of your score.

Feel free to get creative with how coins are generated. Some ideas:
* "Snake" - have a single coin present on the map. Once the player collects it, generate another one somewhere else.
* "Fixed" - generate a few coins when the map loads, and allow the player to walk around and collect them as desired.
* "Timed" - more coins generate throughout the map as time moves on.

Be careful not to let coins spawn on top of the player or on top of other coins!

Extra Credit: Play a sound when the player collects a coin!
