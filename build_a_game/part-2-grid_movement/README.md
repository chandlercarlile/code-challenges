# Grid Movement

We built the layout of a 2D grid based game last time, but we can't do anything yet!

Using the previous challenge as a stepping stone, add the ability to move your "player" around in your grid space.

Exactly how this is implemented is up to you. You can have a terminal input where the user inputs a letter like "w" and then hits enter to submit and have that trigger the changes. You can use live input (not needing to hit enter), or you can add buttons that can be clicked.

Be careful with intercepting input from the user on the command line. You should still be able to exit the game!

Extra Credit: Add world-wrapping. This means if you are on the right side of the grid and you move to the right, you should jump back to the left side- this should apply to all sides equally.
