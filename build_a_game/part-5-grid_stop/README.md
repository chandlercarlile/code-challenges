# GridStop

Next up in this project is having walls! Walls are immovable objects. You cannot walk through them (the player should stop and not move) nor can you push objects on top of or through them either.

This should be a simple one as it is very similar to our previouos challenge where there were some objects that cannot be pushed, and thus became immovable when trying to go through them.

That's it!

Extra Credit:
Rather than just randomly scattering a few random walls in various places on your map, maybe generate something that would make more sense?
