# Jan 27 - Triangle Solver

Given three values of a triangle, calculate the other 3 values.
(Need at least 1 side to calculate)
a, b, c = the length of each side of the triangle
A, B, C = the angles (in degrees) of the opposing corners of the matching letters
Second step will be harder that the first part. Try to solve part 1 first before going into part 2- listed in a thread so you can leave it as a surprise until you've gotten started. ðŸ˜‰
