# Jan 6 - Truth Table Generator

This week's challenge is to build a truth table generator. Given a boolean algebra expression, for example: `!(K && L) || !(!L && !K)`
Generate a truth table that shows all of the possible outputs.
I'll leave an example output off so that you can exercise creativity a bit and generate it the way you'd like. :) Good luck!
